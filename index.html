          <h3>PARASHAR ASTROLOGY</h3>
          <div class="des2">
            <p>
          The most popularly followed astrological classics today
          are the ones written by Rishis like Parashara, Varahamihira,
           Garga, Jaimini and their followers.
          The credit for systematically explaining the entire
          theory of Hindu predictive astrology goes to Rishi
          Parashara, in his magnum opus Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra.
          According to one theory, Brahma taught the Vedas and Jyotisha
          to his son Narada. Narada in turn taught these to Rishi Saunaka.
          Parashara was the disciple of Rishi Saunaka.
          The Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra is in the
          form of dialogs between Rishi
          Parashara and his disciple Maitreya who asks
          questions and Parashara explain the principles.
          Even after 5000 years it is still the best classic on astrology!!

          <h3>JAIMINI ASTROLOGY</h3>
          <div class="des2">
            <p>
           The ancient Sanskrit text called Jaimini Sutras is a treatise
           on the predictive part of Hindu astrology attributed to Maharishi
            Jaimini, the founder of the Purva Mimamsa branch of Hindu
            philosophy and author of twelve-chapter Upadesa Sutras,
            who was a disciple of Rishi Vyasa, son of Parashara.
            It comprises nine hundred and thirty-six sutras or
            aphorisms arranged in four chapters, and though having
            several distinct features of its own, the Jaimini System,
            which is a unique system, appears as an offshoot of the
            Parashari System only;where ever it deviates it is not
            found to be in conflict with the Parashari system,
            and gives due importance to Rahu and Ketu, the two Lunar Nodes.
            It is mainly practised in South India.
